E-xmms 1.3.2
	* Added comparison of previous and current state
	  to determine if window painting should be done
	* Added new handler to make adding icons much easier
	* Added more icons, thanks to the many users who
	  submit them to xmms.org (some icons were slightly 
	  modified for size and appearance)
	* Fixed volume handler for smoother control
	* Minor code clean up

E-xmms 1.3.1
	* Fixed a memory leak related to Title scroll
	* Added jump to position using the progress bar
	* Modified appearance of progress bar if stream
	  is/is not playing
	* Code reorganization

E-xmms 1.3
	* Added icons from xmms.org
	  configuration window to allow icon change
	* Modified the playlist_title display
	* Added changes from Matt DeLuco <duke@spacebox.net>
	  playlist_title view, countdown
	  code cleanup

E-xmms 1.2 involved some major changes to the backend.

	* E-xmms now depends almost totally on xmms (specifically xmmsctrl.h).
	* The above dependence also substantially decreased the size of
	* the epplet, doing away with other unnecessary dependencies.

E-xmms 1.1 incorporates my own changes to the epplet, which added/changed the following:

	* Icon for the initial state.
	* Icon while xmms loads.
	* Moved initial buttons (start xmms, and close epplet)
	* Added play-time above the progress bar.
